# ChadaClockSNHU
This is a C++ project that I created for my CS210 class

-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The goal of this project was to create two clocks--a 12 hour clock and a 24 hour clock. The clocks could be adjusted by a user by adding hours, minutes, or seconds. 
-What did you do particularly well?
  I think i kept the styling of the display very neat. I also made sure that the times were accurate, never going over 12 for the 12-hour clock and never going over 24 for the 24-hour clock.
-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could have added a PM/AM indicator to the 12 hour clock to make the clock a bit more accurate and functional. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found the logic to be the most challenging, and while it wasn't all that hard, I still learned a lot about the syntax of C++
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Problem solving is always a skill I'm looking to improve. It was no different for this project where I used all the resources I could to solve the problem at hand.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  By keeping the functions abstracted into classes, they could be expanded upon in the future. I also made sure to add line comments in my code so that future engineers will be able to more easly understand what is happening in the code.
